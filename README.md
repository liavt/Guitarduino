# Guitarduino
Program that allows Arduino to play music over serial

#How it works
Put the .ino program onto the Arduino, and put 6 buttons into digital ports. The port numbers should be in the program somewhere.

Plug it into a serial port on your computer, and run main.py. Start pressing buttons, and your computer should start playing sounds!

#Installation
In order to run main.py, you need pyserial and pyaudio, both of which can be installed with pip.
